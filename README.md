## About

â€» This plugin is being built on Unreal Engine 5.0.X.

__"Action Camera Manager Plugin"__ is a camera plugin that can be used for various fighting games. There are a total of three modes: __"3D mode"__ used in the same format as the Naruto Ultimate Storm, __"2D mode"__ used in the same format as the Tekken, and __"2D_Fix"__ mode used in the same format as the (old) Tekken.

Since I am a student preparing to get a job, it is difficult to update frequently, but if you give me a lot of feedback, I will try to apply it as much as possible. Thank you :)
